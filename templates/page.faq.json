We go to great lengths to hatch every egg that is laid here at American Ostrich Farms. Our core business is the humane production of live ostriches, from which we produce a variety of value-added products, including premium red meats, pet foods, ultra-hydrating cosmetics, and more. In order for eating egg sales to be economical, we'd have to charge the equivalent of a live chick, which consumers most certainly would not want to pay - even for the opportunity to make the equivalent of a 24-chicken egg omelet(!).\n\nHowever, we do sell empty ostrich eggshells for arts and crafts and decoration. These are eggs that were found to be infertile upon incubation, and thus, no embryo began to develop. We then use a diamond drill bit to create a hole on one end through which we remove the infertile yolk and egg white, and sterilize in a bleach bath before they can be shipped out."}},"8cc4f437-2592-45fb-93d7-1c169881b133":{"type":"the_basics","settings":{"question":"Do you sell edible ostrich eggs?","answer":"We do not sell whole, edible ostrich eggs.
